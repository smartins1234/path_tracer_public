## A Note on Copyrighted Files

This path tracer was created as part of the course CS 6620: Rendering with Ray Tracing taught by Dr. Cem Yuksel at the University of Utah. Some copyrighted code was provided to students, which I used in creating this implementation but do not have the rights to share publicly. These mostly consisted of header files the encouraged a certain project structure but little to no implementation. All of the features of this path tracer listed above were fully written myself.
